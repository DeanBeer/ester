  :aroma: Low to no malt aroma, although it can be perceived as grainy, sweet or corn like if present. Hop aroma slight to none, with a spicy or floral hop character if present. While a clean fermentation character is desirable, a light amount of yeast c haracter (particularly a light apple fruitiness) is not a fault. Light DMS is not a fault.
  :appearance: Very pale straw to pale yellow color. White, frothy head seldom persists. Very clear.
  :flavor: Relatively neutral palate with a crisp and dry finish and a low to very low grainy or corn like flavor that might be perceived as sweetness due to the low bitterness. Hop flavor ranges from none to low levels, and can have a floral, spicy, or herbal quality (although rarely strong enough to detect). Low to very low hop bitterness. Balance may vary from slightly malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels of carbonation may accentuate the crispness of the dry finish. Clean lager fermentation character.
  :mouthfeel: Very light (sometimes watery) body. Very highly carbonated with slight carbonic bite on the tongue.
  :overall_impression: Highly carbonated, very light bodied, nearly flavorless lager designed to be consumed very cold. Very refreshing and thirst quenching.
  :comments: Designed to appeal to the broadest range of the general public as possible.  Strong flavors are a fault.
  :history: Coors briefly made a light lager in the early 1940s. Modern versions were first produced by Rheingold in 1967 to appeal to diet conscious drinkers, but only became popular starting in 1973 after Miller Brewing acquired the recipe and marketed the beer heavily to sports fans with the "tastes great, less filling" campaign. Beers of this genre became the largest sellers in the United States in the 1990s.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Two or six row barley with high percentage (up to 40%) of rice or corn as adjuncts. Additional enzymes can further lighten the body and lower carbohydrates.
  :comparison: A lighter bodied, lower alcohol, lower calorie version of an American Lager. Less hop character and bitterness than a Leichtbier.

  :aroma: Low to no malt aroma, although it can be perceived as grainy, sweet or corn like if present. Hop aroma may range from none to a light, spicy or floral hop presence. While a clean fermentation character is desirable, a light amount of yeast character (particularly a light apple character) is not a fault. Light DMS is also not a fault.
  :appearance: Very pale straw to medium yellow color. White, frothy head seldom persists. Very clear.
  :flavor: Relatively neutral palate with a crisp and dry finish and a moderately low to low grainy or corn like flavor that might be perceived as sweetness due to the low bitterness. Hop flavor ranges from none to moderately low levels, and can have a floral, spicy, or herbal quality (although often not strong enough to distinguish). Hop bitterness at low to medium low level. Balance may vary from slightly malty to slightly bitter, but is relatively close to even. High levels of carbonation may accentuate the crispness of the dry finish. Clean lager fermentation character.
  :mouthfeel: Low to medium low body. Very highly carbonated with slight carbonic bite on the tongue.
  :overall_impression: A very pale, highly carbonated, light bodied, well attenuated lager with a very neutral flavor profile and low bitterness. Served very cold, it can be a very refreshing and thirst quenching drink.
  :comments: Strong flavors are a fault. Often what non-craft beer drinkers expect to be served if they order beer in the United States. May be marketed as Pilsner beers outside of Europe, but should not be confused with traditional examples.
  :history: Although German immigrants had brewed traditional Pilsner inspired lager beer in the United States since the mid-late 1800s, the modern American lager style was heavily influenced by Prohibition and World War II. Surviving breweries consolidated, expanded distribution, and heavily promoted a beer style that was appealing to a broad range of the population.  Became the dominant beer style for many decades, and spawning many international rivals who would develop similarly bland products for the mass market supported by heavy advertising.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Two or six row barley with high percentage (up to 40%) of rice or corn as adjuncts.
  :comparison: Stronger, more flavor and body than a Light American Lager. Less bitterness and flavor than an International Lager. Significantly less flavor, hops, and bitterness than traditional European Pilsners.

  :aroma: Faint malt notes, with a sweet, corn-like aroma. Low levels of DMS are allowable, but are not required. Hop aroma low to none, and can be of any variety although floral, spicy, or herbal notes are most common. Overall, a subtle aroma with neither hops nor malt dominating. Faint esters may be present in some examples, but are not required.  
  :appearance: Pale straw to moderate gold color, although usually on the pale side. Low to medium head with medium to high carbonation. Fair head retention. Brilliant, sparkling clarity.
  :flavor: Low to medium low hop bitterness. Low to moderate maltiness and sweetness, varying with gravity and attenuation.  Usually well attenuated. Neither malt nor hops prevail in the palate. A low to moderate corny flavor is commonly found, as is light DMS (optional). Finish can vary from somewhat dry to faintly sweet. Faint fruity esters are optional. Low to medium-low hop flavor (any variety, but typically floral, spicy, or herbal).
  :mouthfeel: Generally light and crisp, although body can reach medium. Smooth mouthfeel with medium to high attenuation; higher attenuation levels can lend a "thirst quenching" quality. High carbonation. 
  :overall_impression: A clean, well- attenuated, flavorful American lawnmower beer. Easily drinkable and refreshing, with more character than typical American lagers.
  :comments: Pre-prohibition Cream Ales were slightly stronger, hoppier (including some dry hopping) and more bitter (25-30+ IBUs). These versions should be entered in the historical category. Most commercial examples are in the 12.4 - 13.1 OG range, and bitterness rarely rises above 20 IBUs.
  :history: A sparkling or present use ale that existed in the 1800s and survived prohibition. An ale version of the American lager style. Produced by ale brewers to compete with lager brewers in Canada and the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest states.  Originally known as sparkling or present use ales, lager strains were (and sometimes still are) used by some brewers, but were not historically mixed with ale strains. Many examples are kr?usened to achieve carbonation. Cold conditioning isn't traditional, although modern brewers sometimes use it.
  :characteristic_ingredients: American ingredients most commonly used. A grain bill of six-row malt, or a combination of six-row and North American two-row, is common. Adjuncts can include up to 20% flaked maize in the mash, and up to 20% glucose or other sugars in the boil. Soft water preferred. Any variety of hop s can be used for bittering and finishing.
  :comparison: Similar to a Standard American Lager, but with more character.

  :subcategory: D
  :aroma: Low to moderate grainy, bready, or doughy wheat character. A light to moderate malty sweetness is acceptable. Esters can be moderate to none, although should reflect American yeast strains; banana is inappropriate. Hop aroma may be low to moderate, and can have a citrusy, spicy, floral, or fruity character.
  :appearance: Usually pale yellow to gold. Clarity may range from brilliant to hazy with yeast approximating the German weissbier style of beer. Big, long lasting white head.
  :flavor: Light to moderately strong bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavor, which can linger into the finish. May have a moderate malty sweetness or finish quite dry. Low to moderate hop bitterness, which sometimes lasts into the finish. Balance is usually even, but may be slightly bitter. Low to moderate hop flavor (citrusy, spicy, floral, or fruity). Esters can be moderate to none, but should not include banana. No clove phenols. May have a slightly crisp finish.
  :mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Medium-high to high carbonation. Slight creaminess is optional; wheat beers sometimes have a soft, 'fluffy' impression.
  :overall_impression: Refreshing wheat beers that can display more hop character and less yeast character than their German cousins. A clean fermentation character allows bready, doughy, or grainy wheat flavors to be complemented by hop flavor and bitterness rather than yeast qualities.
  :comments: Different variations exist, from an easy-drinking fairly sweet beer to a dry, aggressively hopped beer with a strong wheat flavor. American rye beers should be entered in the Alternative fermentables specialty category.
  :history: An American craft beer adaptation of the German weissbier style using a cleaner yeast and more hops, first widely popularized by Widmer in the mid-1980s.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Clean American ale or lager yeast. Large proportion of wheat malt (often 30-50%, which is lower than is typical in Germany). American, German, or New World hops are typical.
  :comparison: More hop character and less yeast character than German weissbier. Never with the banana and clove character of German weissbier. Generally can have the sa me range and balance as Blonde Ales, but with a wheat character as the primary malt flavor.
