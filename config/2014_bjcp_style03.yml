  :aroma: Light to moderate bready-rich malt combined with light to moderate spicy or herbal hop bouquet; the balance between the two may vary. Faint hint of caramel is acceptable. No to moderate diacetyl but never intrusive. Light, fruity hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present. No sulfur.
  :appearance: Light gold to deep gold color. Brilliant to very clear, with a creamy, long-lasting, creamy white head. 
  :flavor: Medium-low to medium bready-rich malt flavor with a crisp, hoppy finish. Low to medium-high spicy or herbal hop flavor. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. Flavorful but refreshing. Diacetyl or fruity esters are acceptable, but need not be present and should never be overbearing.
  :mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation. 
  :overall_impression: A lighter-bodied, rich, refreshing, hoppy, bitter, crisp pale Czech lager having the familiar flavors of the stronger Czech Pilsner-type beer but in a lower alcohol, lighter-bodied, and slightly less intense format.
  :comments: The proper Czech name of the style is Sv?tl? V??epn? Pivo. 
  :history: Records shows that Pilsner Urquell brewed a 10 ?P beer in 1842-3. This is the most consumed type of beer in the Czech Republic at present.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Soft water with low sulfate and carbonate content, Saazer-type hops, Czech Pilsner malt, Czech lager yeast. Decoction mashing and long, cold fermentation are traditional. Low ion water provides a distinctively soft, rounded hop profile despite high hopping rates. The fermentation process can sometimes provide background diacetyl.
  :comparison: A lighter-bodied, lower-intensity, refreshing, everyday version of Czech Premium Pale Lager.

- :name: Czech Premium Pale Lager
  :category: 3
  :subcategory: B
  :aroma: Medium to medium-high bready-rich malt and medium-low to medium-high spicy, floral, or herbal hop bouquet; though the balance between the two may vary, the interplay is rich and complex. Light to moderate diacetyl, or very low fruity hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present. 
  :appearance: Gold to deep gold color. Brilliant to very clear, with a dense, long-lasting, creamy white head. 
  :flavor: Rich, complex, bready maltiness combined with a pronounced yet soft and rounded bitterness and floral and spicy hop flavor. Malt and hop flavors are medium to medium-high, and the malt may contain a slight impression of caramel. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. The long finish can be balanced towards hops or malt but is never aggressively tilted either way.  Light to moderate diacetyl and low hop-derived esters are acceptable, but need not be present.
  :mouthfeel: Medium body. Moderate to low carbonation. 
  :overall_impression: Rich, characterful pale Czech lager, with considerable malt and hop character and a long, crisp finish.  Complex yet well-balanced and refreshing. The malt flavors are complex for a Pilsner-type beer, and the bitterness is strong but clean and without harshness, which gives a rounded impression that enhances drinkability.
  :comments: Generally a group of "Pivo Plze?sk?ho Typ?", or Pilsner-style beers. This style is a combination of the Czech styles Sv?tl? Le??k (4.4-5.0%) and Sv?tl? Speci?ln? Pivo (5.3-5.8%). In the Czech Republic, only Pilsner Urquell is called a Pilsner, despite how widely adopted this name is worldwide. "Kvasnicov?" ("yeast beer") versions are popular in the Czech Republic, and may be either kr?usened or unfiltered. These beers are sometimes cloudy, with subtle yeastiness and enhanced hop character.  Modern examples vary in their malt to hop balance and many are not as hop-forward as Pilsner Urquell.
  :history: Commonly associated with Pilsner Urquell, which was first brewed in 1842 after construction of a new brewhouse by burghers dissatisfied with the standard of beer brewed in Plze?. Bavarian brewer Josef Groll is credited with first brewing the beer.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Soft water with low sulfate and carbonate content, Saazer-type hops, Czech malt, Czech lager yeast.  Decoction mashing and long, cold fermentation are traditional. Low ion water provides a distinctively soft, rounded hop profile despite high hopping rates. The fermentation process can sometimes provide background diacetyl.
  :comparison: More color, malt richness, and body than a German Pils, with a fuller finish and a cleaner, softer impression.

- :name: Czech Amber Lager
  :category: 3
  :subcategory: C
  :aroma: Moderate intensity, rich malt aroma that can be either bready and Maillard product-dominant or slightly caramelly and candy-like. Spicy, floral or herbal hop character may be moderate to none. Clean lager character, though low fruity esters (stone fruit or berries) may be present. Diacetyl is optional and can range from low to none.
  :appearance: Deep amber to copper color. Bright to clear. Large, off-white, persistent head. 
  :flavor: Malt flavor complexity is dominant (medium to medium-high), though its nature may vary from dry and Maillard product-dominant to caramelly and almost sweet. Some example have a candy-like to graham-cracker malt character. Low to moderate spicy hop flavor. Prominent but clean hop bitterness provides a balanced finish. Subtle plum or berry esters optional.  Low diacetyl optional. No roasted malt flavor. Finish may vary from dry and hoppy to relatively sweet.
  :mouthfeel: Medium-full to medium body. Soft and round, often with a gentle creaminess. Moderate to low carbonation.
  :overall_impression: Malt-driven amber Czech lager with hop character that can vary from low to quite significant. The malt flavors can vary quite a bit, leading to different interpretations ranging from drier, bready, and slightly biscuity to sweeter and somewhat caramelly.
  :comments: The Czech name of the style is Polotmav? Pivo, which translates as half dark.  This style is a combination of the Czech styles Polotmav? Le??k (4.4-5.0%) and  Polotmav? Speci?ln? Pivo (5.3-5.8%).
  :history: Vienna-style lager which has continued to be brewed in the Czech Republic. A resurgence of small breweries opening in the Czech Republic has increased the number of examples of this style. 
  :characteristic_ingredients: Pilsner and caramel malts, but Vienna and Munich malts may also be used. Soft water with low mineral content, Saazer-type hops, Czech lager yeast. Decoction mashing and long, cold fermentation are traditional.
  :comparison: The style can vary from similar to a Vienna lager but with Saazer-type hop character, to having significantly richer and more caramelly character approaching that of an amber ale or bitter. Large brewery versions are generally similar to Czech Pilsners with slightly darker malt flavors and less hop, while smaller breweries often make versions with considerable hop character, malt complexity, or residual sweetness.

- :name: Czech Dark Lager
  :category: 3
  :subcategory: D
  :aroma: Medium to medium-high rich, deep, sometimes sweet maltiness, with optional qualities such as bread crusts, toast, nuts, cola, dark fruit, or caramel. Roasted malt characters such as chocolate or sweetened coffee can vary from moderate to none but should not overwhelm the base malt character. Low, spicy hop aroma is optional. Low to moderate diacetyl and low fruity esters (plums or berries) may be present.
  :appearance: Dark copper to almost black, often with a red or garnet tint. Bright to clear. Large, off-white to tan, persistent head.
  :flavor: Medium to medium-high deep, complex maltiness dominates, typically with malty-rich Maillard products and a light to moderate residual malt sweetness. Malt flavors such as caramel, toast, nuts, licorice, dried dark fruit, chocolate and coffee may also be present, with very low to moderate roast character. Spicy hop flavor can be moderately-low to none. Hop bitterness may be moderate to medium-low but should be perceptible. Balance can vary from malty to relatively well-balanced to gently hop-forward. Low to moderate diacetyl and light plum or berry esters may be present. 
  :mouthfeel: Medium to medium-full body, considerable mouthfeel without being heavy or cloying. Moderately creamy in texture. Smooth. Moderate to low carbonation. Can have a slight alcohol warmth in stronger versions.
  :overall_impression: A rich, dark, malty Czech lager with a roast character that can vary from almost absent to quite prominent.  Malty with an interesting and complex flavor profile, with variable levels of hopping providing a range of possible interpretations.
  :comments: This style is a combination of the Czech styles Tmav? Le??k (4.4-5.0%) and Tmav? Speci?ln? Pivo (5.3-5.8%).  More modern examples are drier and have higher bitterness while traditional versions often have IBUs in the 18-20 range with a sweeter balance.
  :history: The U Flek? brewery has been operating in Prague since 1499. Many small, new breweries are brewing this style.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Pilsner and dark caramel malts with the addition of debittered roasted malts are most common, but additions of Vienna or Munich malt are also appropriate. Soft water with low mineral content, Saazer-type hops, Czech lager yeast. Decoction mashing and long, cold fermentation are traditional. Any fruity esters are typically from malt, not yeast.
  :comparison: The beer is the Czech equivalent of a dark lager ranging in character from Munich Dunkel to Schwarzbier, but typically with greate r malt richness and hop character (aroma, flavor, and/or bitterness).
