  :name: Vienna Lager
  :aroma: Moderately-intense malt aroma, with toasty and malty-rich aromatics.  A light toasted malt aroma may be present. Clean lager character, with no fruity esters or diacetyl. Floral, spicy hop aroma may be low to none. A significant caramel or roasted aroma is inappropriate.
  :appearance: Light reddish amber to copper color. Bright clarity. Large, off-white, persistent head.
  :flavor: Soft, elegant malt complexity is in the forefront, with a firm enough hop bitterness to provide a balanced finish. The malt flavor tends towards a rich, toasty character, without significant caramel or roast flavors. Fairly dry finish, with both rich malt and hop bitterness present in the aftertaste. Floral, spicy hop flavor may be low to none. Clean lager fermentation character.
  :mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body, with a gentle creaminess. Moderate carbonation. Smooth. Moderately crisp finish. 
  :overall_impression: A moderate-strength amber lager with a soft, smooth maltiness and moderate bitterness, yet finishing relatively dry. The malt flavor is clean, bready-rich, and somewhat toasty, with an elegant impression derived from quality base malts and process, not specialty malts and adjuncts.
  :comments: A standard-strength everyday beer, not a beer brewed for festivals. American versions can be a bit stronger, drier and more bitter, while modern European versions tend to be sweeter. Many Mexican amber and dark lagers used to be more authentic, but unfortunately are now more like sweet, adjunct-laden Amber/Dark American Lagers. Regrettably, many modern examples use adjuncts which lessen the rich malt complexity characteristic of the best examples of this style. This style is on the watch list to move to the Historical category in future guidelines; that would allow the classic style to be described while moving the sweeter modern versions to the International Amber or Dark Lager styles.
  :history: Developed by Anton Dreher in Vienna in 1841, became popular in the mid-late 1800s. Now nearly extinct in its area of origin, the style continues in Mexico where it was brought by Santiago Graf and other Austrian immigrant brewers in the late 1800s. Authentic examples are increasingly hard to find (except perhaps in the craft beer industry) as formerly good examples become sweeter and use more adjuncts.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Vienna malt provides a lightly toasty and complex, Maillard-rich malt profile. As with M?rzens, only the finest quality malt should be used, along with Continental hops (preferably Saazer types or Styrians). Any kind of water can be used, but it should not have significant sulfates. Can use some caramel malts and/or darker malts to add color and sweetness, but caramel malts shouldn't add significant aroma and flavor and dark malts shouldn't provide any roasted character.
  :comparison: Lighter malt character, slightly less body, and slightly more bitter in the balance than M?rzens, yet still decidedly balanced toward malt with many of the same malt-derived flavors. The malt character is similar to a M?rzen, but less intense. Lower in alcohol than M?rzen or Festbier. Less rich, less malty and less hop centered compared to Czech Amber Lager.

  :name: Altbier
  :aroma: Clean yet robust and complex aroma of grainy-rich malt and spicy hops with restrained (low to medium-low) fruity esters. The malt character reflects German base malt varieties, with rich baked bread and nutty-toasty bread crust notes. The hop aroma may vary from moderate to low, and can have a peppery, spicy, floral, herbal or perfumy character associated with Saazer-type hops. 
  :appearance: The color ranges from light amber to deep copper color, stopping short of brown; bronze-orange is most common.  Brilliant clarity. Thick, creamy, long-lasting off-white head.
  :flavor: Assertive hop bitterness well balanced by a sturdy yet clean and crisp malt character. The malt presence is moderated by medium-high to high attenuation, but considerable rich and complex malt flavors can remain. Some fruity esters may survive the lagering period. A long-lasting, medium-dry to dry, bittersweet or nutty finish reflects both the hop bitterness and malt complexity. Spicy, peppery or floral hop flavor can be moderate to low. No roasted malt flavors or harshness.  The apparent bitterness level is sometimes masked by the malt character; the bitterness can seem as low as moderate if the finish is not very dry. Light sulfury or minerally character optional.
  :mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Smooth. Medium to medium-high carbonation, although can be lower when served from the cask.  Astringency low to none. Despite being very full of flavor, is light-bodied enough to be consumed as a gravity-fed session beer in its home brewpubs in D?sseldorf.
  :overall_impression: A well-balanced, well-attenuated, bitter yet malty, clean, and smooth, amber-to copper-colored German beer. The bitterness is balanced by the malt richness, but the malt intensity and character can range from moderate to high (the bitterness increases with the malt richness). 
  :comments: A top-fermented lagered beer, fermented at cool ale temperature (59-68 ?F), often conditioned at bottom-fermentation temperatures (about 50 ?F) and then lagered at cold temperatures to produce a cleaner, smoother palate than is typical for most ales. Zum Uerige is a wonderful beer, but much more aggressively bitter and complex than the other German examples. It may be like the Fuller's ESB of the strong bitter category-well-known but somewhat of a stylistic outlier. Do not judge all Altbiers as if they were Zum Uerige clones; allow for a more balanced bitterness in the beer (25-35 IBUs is more typical for most other German examples).
  :history: The traditional style of beer from D?sseldorf. "Alt" refers to the "old" style of brewing (i.e., using top-fermenting yeast) that was common before bottom-fermenting lager brewing became popular. Predates the isolation of bottom-fermenting yeast strains, though it approximates many characteristics of bottom-fermenting lager beers. Many of the classic ex amples can be found in brewpubs in the Altstadt ("old town") section of D?sseldorf.  
  :characteristic_ingredients: Grists vary, but usually consist of German base malts (usually Pils, sometimes Munich) with small amounts of crystal, chocolate, and/or black malts used to adjust color. Occasionally will include some wheat, including roasted wheat. Spalt hops are traditional, but other Saazer-type hops can also be used. Moderately carbonate water. Clean, highly attenuative ale yeast. A step mash or decoction mash program is traditional.
  :comparison: More bitter and malty than international amber lagers. Somewhat similar to California Common, both in production technique and finished flavor and color, though not in ingredients.

  :name: Kellerbier
  :aroma: Reflects base style. Typically has additional yeast character, with byproducts not frequently found in well-lagered German beers (such as diacetyl, sulfur, and acetaldehyde).
  :appearance: Reflects base style. Typically can be somewhat hazy or cloudy, and likely a little darker in appearance than the base style.
  :flavor: Reflects base style. Typically has additional yeast character, with some byproducts not frequently found in well-lagered German beers (such as diacetyl, sulfur, and acetaldehyde), although not at objectionable levels.
  :mouthfeel: Reflects base style. Has a bit more body and creamy texture due to yeast in suspension, and may have a slight slickness if diacetyl is present. May have a lower carbonation than the base style.
  :comments: Young, unfiltered, unpasteurized versions of the traditional German beer styles, traditionally served on tap from the lagering vessel. The name literally means "cellar beer"-implying a young, fresh beer served straight from the lagering cellar.  Since this serving method can be applied to a wide range of beers, the style is somewhat hard to pin down. However, there are several common variants that can be described and used as templates for other versions. Sometimes described as Naturtr?b or naturally cloudy. Also sometimes called Zwickelbier, after the name of the tap used to sample from a lagering tank.
  :history: Originally, Kellerbier referred to any Lager beer being matured in the caves or cellars under the brewery, but when refrigeration began to be used, the term shifted to describing special beers that were served young, directly from the cellar or lagering vessel.  Today some breweries use the term purely for marketing purposes to make their beers appear special. While a kellerbier is sometimes considered more of a serving style than a beer style, the serving technique is still predominately used with certain styles in certain regions (such as Helles around the Munich area, or a M?rzen in the Franconia region).
  :entry_instructions: The entrant must specify whether the entry is a Munich Kellerbier (pale, based on Helles) or a Franconian Kellerbier (amber, based on M?rzen). The entrant can specify another type of Kellerbier based on other base styles such as Pils, Bock, Schwarzbier, but should supply a style description for judges.

  :name: Munich Kellerbier
  :aroma: Moderately-low to moderately-high spicy, floral, or herbal hop aroma.  Very low to moderate diacetyl, possible very low green apple or other yeast derived notes. Pleasantly grainy-sweet, clean malt aroma, with possible low background note of DMS.
  :appearance: Slight haze to moderately cloudy, but never extremely cloudy or murky. Medium yellow to pale gold color.  Creamy white head with good persistence.
  :flavor: Moderately malty with a rounded, grainy-sweet profile. Low to moderately-high spicy, floral, or herbal hop flavor, with a moderate hop bitterness that can linger. Finish is crisp and dry, but the aftertaste remains malty. Very low to moderate diacetyl, which should always remain at a pleasant, drinkable level that balances somewhat with the other characteristics of the beer; overwhelming diacetyl is not appropriate. Possible very low green apple or other yeast derived notes, and possible low background note of DMS. Crisp and dry, slightly bitter finish with a smooth maltiness in the aftertaste.
  :mouthfeel: Medium body. Low to medium carbonation. Depending on the level of yeast in suspension, it may assist in creating a slightly creamy texture. A slight slickness on the tongue may be present from the diacetyl.
  :overall_impression: A young, fresh Helles, so while still a malty, fully-attenuated Pils malt showcase, the hop character (aroma, flavor and bitterness) is more pronounced, and the beer is cloudy, often with some level of diacetyl, and possibly has some green apple and/or other yeast-derived notes. As with the traditional Helles, the Keller version is still a beer intended to be drank by the liter, so overall it should remain a light, refreshing, easy drinking golden lager.
  :comments: A very common seasonal summer beer brewed by many of the Munich area breweries and served in the beer gardens, where they are very popular.  Most Munich Kellerbiers are young, unfiltered, unpasteurized versions of Munich Helles beer, although Pils or a different, custom golden lager beer designed specifically for serving young could also be used. The best examples are served only on tap at many of the Munich area breweries. Bottled versions are not likely to have the freshness, hop character and young beer notes exhibited by the draft versions.  
  :history: Modern adaptation from the traditional Franconian style, using Helles instead of M?rzen. Today, a popular summer seasonal beer. 
  :characteristic_ingredients: Pilsner malt, German hops, German lager yeast; same as a Munich Helles.
  :style_comparison: Most commonly, a young, unfiltered and unpasteurized version of a Munich Helles, though it can be a young, unfiltered and unpasteurized version of other golden German lagers, such as a Pilsner or a seasonal golden lager made specifically for serving young.

  :name: Franconian Kellerbier
  :aroma: Moderate intensity of German malt, typically rich, bready, somewhat toasty, with light bread crust notes. Moderately-low to moderate spicy peppery hop aroma. Very low to low diacetyl, occasionally low to moderately-low sulfur and very low green apple or other yeast-derived notes. Caramel, biscuity, or roasted malt aroma is inappropriate.
  :appearance: Moderately cloudy to clear depending on age, but never extremely cloudy or murky. Gold to deep reddish-amber color. Off-white, creamy head.
  :flavor: Initial malt flavor may suggest sweetness, but finish is moderately dry to dry. Distinctive and complex maltiness often includes a bready-toasty aspect. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately high, and spicy or herbal hop flavor is low to moderately high. Balance can be either on the malt or hop side, but the finish is not sweet. Noticeable caramel or roasted malt flavors are inappropriate. Very low to low diacetyl. Possible very low green apple or other yeast-derived notes. May have a crisp and dry, slightly bitter finish with a smooth, malty aftertaste.
  :mouthfeel: Medium body, with a creamy texture and medium carbonation. Fully fermented, without a sweet or cloying impression.
  :overall_impression: A young, unfiltered, and unpasteurized beer that is between a Helles and M?rzen in color, spicier in the hops with greater attenuation. Interpretations range in color and balance, but remain in the drinkable 4.8% ABV neighborhood.  Balance ranges from the dry, spicy and pale-colored interpretations by St. Georgen and Lowenbrau of Buttenheim, to darker and maltier interpretations in the Fr?nkische Schweiz. This style is above all a method of producing simple drinkable beers for neighbors out of local ingredients to be served fresh. Balance with a focus on drinkability and digestibility is important.
  :comments: The original style of Kellerbier from the Franconia area of Germany. A much older style compared to the relatively more recent Munich-Style Kellerbier that is popular in the Munich area today.  The best examples of Franconia-Style Kellerbier are served only on tap at many of the small Franconia area breweries (as this is a beer best served fresh and the serving style being an important part of the style). Bottled versions are not likely to have the freshness, hop character and young beer notes exhibited by the draft versions.
  :history: This classic, historical style before adapted in other areas. This original, older style of Kellerbier would have simply been beer served from local taverns that did not lager long enough to drop bright. Many breweries in Franconia would use some of this young beer during the summer months, for festivals such as the Annafest (est. 1840) in July in Forcheim, where it was traditional to drink directly from the lagering vessels.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Grist varies, although traditional German versions emphasized Franconian pale and colo malt. The notion of elegance is derived from the high-quality local ingredients, particularly the malts. Spalt or other typically spicy local hops are most common. Frugal Franconian brewers rarely used decoction brewing due to the cost of energy.
  :style_comparison: Most commonly, young, unfiltered, and unpasteurized hoppier versions of Helles or classic amber M?rzen.  Fr?nkische Schweiz versions can edge up to dark amber or brown.
