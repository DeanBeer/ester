  :name: Dark Mild
  :aroma: Low to moderate malt aroma, and may have some fruitiness. The malt expression can take on a wide range of character, which can include caramelly, toffee, grainy, toasted, nutty, chocolate, or lightly roasted. Little to no hop aroma, earthy or floral if present. Very low to no diacetyl.  
  :appearance: Copper to dark brown or mahogany color. A few paler examples (medium amber to light brown) exist. Generally clear, although is traditionally unfiltered. Low to moderate off-white to tan head. Retention may be poor due to low carbonation, adjunct use or low gravity.
  :flavor: Generally a malty beer, although may have a very wide range of malt-and yeast-based flavors (e.g., malty, sweet, caramel, toffee, toast, nutty, chocolate, coffee, roast, fruit, licorice, plum, raisin). Can finish sweet to dry. Versions with darker malts may have a dry, roasted finish. Low to moderate bitterness, enough to provide some balance but not enough to overpower the malt. Fruity esters moderate to none. Diacetyl and hop flavor low to none.
  :mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Generally low to medium-low carbonation. Roast-based versions may have a light astringency. Sweeter versions may seem to have a rather full mouthfeel for the gravity.
  :overall_impression: A dark, low-gravity, malt-focused English session ale readily suited to drinking in quantity. Refreshing, yet flavorful, with a wide range of dark malt or dark sugar expression.
  :comments: Most are low-gravity session beers around 3.2%, although some versions may be made in the stronger (4%+) range for export, festivals, seasonal and/or special occasions. Generally served on cask; session-strength bottled versions don't often travel well.  A wide range of interpretations are possible.
  :history: Historically, 'mild' was simply an unaged beer, and could be used as an adjective to distinguish between aged or more highly hopped keeping beers. Modern milds trace their roots to the weaker English X ales of the 1800s, although dark milds did not appear until the 20th century. In current usage, the term implies a lower-strength beer with less hop bitterness than bitters. The guidelines describe the modern English version. The term 'mild' is currently somewhat out of favor with consumers, and many breweries no longer use it. Increasingly rare.
  :style_comparison: Some versions may seem like lower-gravity English porters.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Pale English base malts (often fairly dextrinous), crystal malt, dark malts or dark sugar adjuncts, may also include adjuncts such as flaked maize, and may be colored with brewer's caramel. Characterful English ale yeast. Any type of hops, since their character is muted and rarely is noticeable.

  :subcategory: B
  :name: English Brown Ale
  :aroma: Light , sweet malt aroma with toffee, nutty, or light chocolate notes, and a light to heavy caramel quality. A light but appealing floral or earthy hop aroma may also be noticed. A light fruity aroma may be evident, but should not dominate. 
  :appearance: Dark amber to dark reddish-brown color. Clear. Low to moderate off-white to light tan head.
  :flavor: Gentle to moderate malt sweetness, with a light to heavy caramel character and a medium to dry finish. Malt may also have a nutty, toasted, biscuity, toffee, or light chocolate character. Medium to medium-low bitterness. Malt-hop balance ranges from even to malt-focused; hop flavor low to none (floral or earthy qualities). Low to moderate fruity esters can be present.
  :mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Medium to medium-high carbonation.
  :overall_impression: A malty, brown caramel-centric English ale without the roasted flavors of a Porter. 
  :comments: A wide-ranging category with different interpretations possible, ranging from lighter-colored to hoppy to deeper, darker, and caramel-focused; however, none of the versions have strongly roasted flavors.
  :history: Brown ale has a long history in England; however, historical brown ale was superseded by porter. Modern English brown ale is a 20th century creation as a bottled product. A wide range of gravities were brewed, but modern brown ales are generally of the stronger (by current UK standards) interpretation. This style is based on the modern stronger English brown ales, not historical versions or the sweeter London brown ale. Predominately not exclusively a bottled product currently.
  :characteristic_ingredients: English mild ale or pale ale malt base with caramel malts. May also have small amounts darker malts (e.g., chocolate) to provide color and the nutty character.  English hop varieties are most authentic. 
  :style_comparison: More malty balance than English bitters, with more malt flavors from darker grains. Stronger than a dark mild.

  :subcategory: C
  :name: English Porter
  :aroma: Moderate to moderately low bready-biscuity-toasty malt aroma with mild roastiness, and may have a chocolate quality.  May also show some non-roasted malt character in support (caramelly, nutty, toffee-like and/or sweet). May have up to a moderate level of floral or earthy hops. Fruity esters moderate to none. Diacetyl low to none.
  :appearance: Light brown to dark brown in color, often with ruby highlights when held up to light. Good clarity, although may approach being opaque. Moderate off-white to light tan head with good to fair retention.  
  :flavor: Moderate bready-biscuity-toasty malt flavor includes a mild to moderate roastiness (frequently with a chocolate character) and often a significant caramel, nutty, and/or toffee character. May have other secondary flavors such as coffee, licorice, biscuits or toast in support. Should not have a significant burnt or harsh roasted flavor, although small amounts may contribute a bitter chocolate complexity. Earthy or floral hop flavor moderate to none. Medium-low to medium hop bitterness will vary the balance from slightly malty to slightly bitter. Usually fairly well-attenuated, although can be somewhat sweet.  Diacetyl moderately-low to none. Moderate to low fruity esters.  
  :mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Moderately-low to moderately-high carbonation. Light to moderate creamy texture.
  :overall_impression: A moderate-strength brown beer with a restrained roasty character and bitterness. May have a range of roasted flavors, generally without burnt qualities, and often has a chocolate-caramel-malty profile.
  :comments: Simply called "Porter" in Britain, the name "English Porter" is used to differentiate it from other porters described in these guidelines.  This style description describes the modern version of English porter, not every possible variation over time in every region where it existed. Historical re-creations should be entered in the Historical style category, with an appropriate description describing the profile of the beer. Modern craft examples in the UK are bigger and hoppier.
  :history: Originating in London around 300 years ago, porter evolved from earlier sweet, brown ales popular at the time. Evolved many times with various technological and ingredient developments and consumer preferences driving these changes. Became a highly-popular, widely-exported style in the 1800s before declining around WWI and disappearing in the 1950s. It was re-introduced in the mid-1970s with the start of the craft beer era. The name is said to have been derived from its popularity with the London working class performing various load-carrying tasks of the day. Parent of various regional interpretations over time, and a predecessor to all stouts (which were originally called "stout porters").
  :characteristic_ingredients: Grists vary, but something producing a dark color is always involved . Chocolate or other dark-roasted malts, caramel malt, brewing sugars, and the like are common. London-type porters often use brown malt as a characteristic flavor. 
  :style_comparison: Differs from an American porter in that it usually has softer, sweeter and more caramelly flavors, lower gravities, and usually less alcohol; the American porter will also typically have more of a hop character. More substance and roast than a brown ale. Higher in gravity than a dark mild.
