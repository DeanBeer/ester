  :name: Ordinary Bitter
  :aroma: Low to moderate malt aroma, often (but not always) with a caramel quality. Bready, biscuity, or lightly toasty malt complexity is common. Mild to moderate fruitiness. Hop aroma can range from moderate to none, typically with a floral, earthy, resiny, and/or fruity character. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed. 
  :appearance: Pale amber to light copper color. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white to off-white head. May have very little head due to low carbonation.
  :flavor: Medium to high bitterness. Moderately low to moderately high fruity esters. Moderate to low hop flavor, typically with an earthy, resiny, fruity, and/or floral character. Low to medium maltiness with a dry finish. The malt profile is typically bready, biscuity, or lightly toasty. Caramel or toffee flavors are common but not required. Balance is often decidedly bitter, although the bitterness should not completely overpower the malt flavor, esters and hop flavor. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.
  :mouthfeel: Light to medium-light body. Low carbonation, although bottled examples can have moderate carbonation.
  :overall_impression: Low gravity, low alcohol levels, and low carbonation make this an easy-drinking session beer. The malt profile can vary in flavor and intensity, but should never override the overall bitter impression. Drinkability is a critical component of the style 
  :comments: The lowest gravity member of the English Bitter family, typically known to consumers simply as "bitter" (although brewers tend to refer to it as Ordinary Bitter to distinguish it from other members of the family). 
  :history: See comments in category introduction.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Pale ale, amber, and/or crystal malts. May use a touch of dark malt for color adjustment.  May use sugar adjuncts, corn, or wheat. English finishing hops are most traditional, but any hops are fair game; if American hops are used, a light touch is required. Characterful English yeast. 
  :style_comparison: Some modern variants are brewed exclusively with pale malt and are known as golden ales, summer ales, or golden bitters. Emphasis is on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales.

  :aroma: Low to moderate malt aroma, often (but not always) with a caramel quality. Bready, biscuit, or lightly toasty malt complexity is common. Mild to moderate fruitiness.  Hop aroma can range from moderate to none, typically with a floral, earthy, resiny, and/or fruity character. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.
  :appearance: Pale amber to medium copper color. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white to off-white head.  May have very little head due to low carbonation.

  :mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium body. Low carbonation, although bottled examples can have moderate carbonation.
  :overall_impression: A flavorful, yet refreshing, session beer. Some examples can be more malt balanced, but this should not override the overall bitter impression. Drinkability is a critical component of the style.
  :comments: More evident malt flavor than in an ordinary bitter, this is a stronger, session-strength ale. 
  :history: See comments in category introduction.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Pale ale, amber, and/or crystal malts. May use a touch of dark malt for color adjustment.  May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English finishing hops are most traditional, but any hops are fair game; if American hops are used, a light touch is required. Characterful English yeast.  
  :style_comparison: More alcohol than an ordinary bitter, and often using higher-quality ingredients. Less alcohol than a strong bitter. More caramel or base malt character and color than an English Golden Ale. Emphasis is on the bittering hop addition as opposed to the aggressive middle and late hopping seen in American ales.

  :name: Strong Bitter
  :aroma: Hop aroma moderately-high to moderately-low, typically with a floral, earthy, resiny, and/or fruity character. Medium to medium-high malt aroma, often with a low to moderate caramel compone nt. Medium-low to medium-high fruity esters.  Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed. 
  :appearance: Light amber to deep copper color. Good to brilliant clarity. Low to moderate white to off-white head. A low head is acceptable when carbonation is also low.
  :flavor: Medium to medium-high bitterness with supporting malt flavors evident. The malt profile is typically bready, biscuity, nutty, or lightly toasty, and normally has a moderately low to moderate caramel or toffee flavor. Hop flavor moderate to moderately high, typically with a floral, earthy, resiny, and/or fruity character. Hop bitterness and flavor should be noticeable, but should not totally dominate malt flavors. Moderately-low to high fruity esters. Optionally may have low amounts of alcohol.  Medium-dry to dry finish. Generally no diacetyl, although very low levels are allowed.
  :mouthfeel: Medium-light to medium-full body. Low to moderate carbonation, although bottled versions will be higher.  Stronger versions may have a slight a lcohol warmth but this character should not be too high.
  :overall_impression: An average-strength to moderately-strong English bitter ale. The balance may be fairly even between malt and hops to somewhat bitter. Drinkability is a critical component of the style. A rather broad style that allows for considerable interpretation by the brewer.
  :comments: Fuller's ESB has been moved to the English Strong Ale category since it has a very large, complex malt profile not found in other examples, and often causes judges to incorrectly evaluate beers of this style. In England today, "ESB" is a Fullers trademark, and no one thinks of it as a generic class of beer; in America, the name has been co-opted to describe a malty, bitter, reddish, standard-strength (for the US) English-type ale, and is a popular craft beer style. This may cause some judges to think of US brewpub ESBs as representative of this style. Judges should take note of this move, and understand that the malt character of that specific beer is not typical for this style. 
  :history: See comments in category introduction. Strong bitters can be seen as a higher-gravity version of best bitters (although not necessarily "more premium" since best bitters are traditionally the brewer's finest product). English pale ales are generally considered a premium, export-strength pale, bitter beer that roughly approximates a strong bitter, although reformulated for bottling (including increasing carbonation levels). While modern English pale ale is considered a bottled bitter, historically the styles were different.
  :characteristic_ingredients: Pale ale, amber, and/or crystal malts, may use a touch of black malt for color adjustment.  May use sugar adjuncts, corn or wheat. English finishing hops are most traditional, but any hops are fair game; if American hops are used, a light touch is required. Characterful English yeast. Burton versions use medium to high sulfate water, which can increase the perception of dryness and add a minerally or sulfury aroma and flavor.
  :style_comparison: More evident malt and hop flavors than in a special or best bitter, as well as more alcohol. Stronger versions may overlap somewhat with English strong ales, although strong bitters will tend to be paler and more bitter. More malt flavor (particularly caramel) and esters than an American Pale Ale, with different finishing hop character.
